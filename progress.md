# Prediction App Development Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Core App Structure
- ✅ Project initialized with Vite, React, TypeScript
- ✅ Created plan.md with implementation strategy
- ✅ Set up basic UI structure with arcade-style theme
- ✅ Implemented tab navigation between "Create" and "Reveal" views

### Prediction Creation
- ✅ Implemented prediction input interface
- ✅ Added salt generation and hashing functionality
- ✅ Created mock blockchain transaction for storing hashes on Base

### WebAuthn Integration
- ✅ Created WebAuthn utility module for passkey operations
- ✅ Added largeBlob support for storing prediction content
- ✅ Implemented fallbacks for browsers without WebAuthn/largeBlob support

### Prediction Revelation
- ✅ Developed UI for displaying stored predictions
- ✅ Added reveal mechanism with sharing functionality
- ✅ Integrated with Farcaster SDK for sharing capabilities

### Visual Design
- ✅ Implemented dark, arcade-like theme with dotted lines
- ✅ Added responsive styling for all components
- ✅ Created pulse animation for dotted background

## Current Status
The app is functional with the following features:
1. Users can create and store predictions
2. Predictions are salted and hashed for privacy
3. Original predictions can be revealed later
4. Predictions can be shared to Twitter with timestamp proof
5. WebAuthn is used when available, with localStorage fallback
6. Successfully builds without TypeScript errors
7. Compatibility with wagmi v2 API

## Next Steps
1. **Code Quality**
   - Address remaining linting issues with biome check --fix --unsafe
   - Refactor code for better organization and maintainability

2. **Contract Deployment**
   - Deploy an actual smart contract on Base to store prediction hashes
   - Update blockchain.ts to use the deployed contract

3. **Testing**
   - Test WebAuthn functionality in browsers that support it
   - Verify Farcaster sharing integration
   - Create end-to-end test suite

4. **Enhanced Security**
   - Improve error handling for WebAuthn operations
   - Add verification UI to show proof of prediction timeliness

5. **UI Refinements**
   - Add animations for revealing predictions
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
