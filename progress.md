# Prediction App Development Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Core App Structure
- ✅ Project initialized with Vite, React, TypeScript
- ✅ Created plan.md with implementation strategy
- ✅ Set up basic UI structure with arcade-style theme
- ✅ Implemented tab navigation between "Create" and "Reveal" views

### Authentication Flow
- ✅ Added login/register views for passkey management
- ✅ Implemented passkey creation with largeBlob support
- ✅ Added persistent authentication state management using localStorage
- ✅ Built login/logout functionality
- ✅ Set default user identity to "Predictor"
- ✅ Implemented cache expiry mechanism to minimize passkey prompts

### Blockchain Integration
- ✅ Created Solidity smart contract for storing prediction hashes on Base
- ✅ Implemented verification functions to prove prediction timestamps
- ✅ Built React hooks for interacting with the contract
- ✅ Maintained mock implementation for testing without a deployed contract
- ✅ Configured environment variables for contract deployment
- ✅ Fixed browser environment compatibility issues

### Prediction Creation
- ✅ Implemented prediction input interface
- ✅ Added salt generation and hashing functionality
- ✅ Connected to Base blockchain for storing hashes

### WebAuthn Integration
- ✅ Created WebAuthn utility module for passkey operations
- ✅ Added largeBlob support for storing prediction content
- ✅ Implemented WebAuthn detection and feature checking
- ✅ Built robust fallbacks for browsers without WebAuthn/largeBlob support
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript typings for WebAuthn largeBlob API

### Prediction Revelation
- ✅ Developed UI for displaying stored predictions
- ✅ Added reveal mechanism with sharing functionality
- ✅ Integrated with Farcaster SDK for sharing capabilities
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for all operations

### Visual Design
- ✅ Implemented dark, arcade-like theme with dotted lines
- ✅ Added responsive styling for all components
- ✅ Created auth views with proper styling
- ✅ Created pulse animation for dotted background

## Current Status
The app is functional with the following features:
1. Login/register flow using WebAuthn passkeys with largeBlob storage and persistent sessions
2. Users can create and store predictions securely in their passkey with efficient caching
3. Base blockchain integration for storing and verifying prediction hashes
4. Predictions are salted and hashed for privacy with on-chain verification
5. Original predictions can be revealed later with timestamp proof
6. Predictions can be shared to Twitter with timestamp proof and blockchain verification
7. WebAuthn largeBlob is used when available, with localStorage fallback
8. Smart contract for on-chain storage and verification of prediction timestamps
9. Successfully builds without TypeScript errors using proper WebAuthn type definitions
10. Compatibility with wagmi v2 API
11. Responsive arcade-style design with magnifying glass logo
12. Fixed Safari WebAuthn detection
13. Complete set of TypeScript type definitions

## Next Steps
1. **Code Quality**
   - Address remaining linting issues with biome check --fix --unsafe
   - Refactor code for better organization and maintainability

2. **Contract Deployment**
   - Deploy an actual smart contract on Base to store prediction hashes
   - Update blockchain.ts to use the deployed contract

3. **Testing**
   - Test WebAuthn functionality in browsers that support it
   - Verify Farcaster sharing integration
   - Create end-to-end test suite

4. **Enhanced Security**
   - Improve error handling for WebAuthn operations
   - Add verification UI to show proof of prediction timeliness

5. **UI Refinements**
   - Add animations for revealing predictions
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
